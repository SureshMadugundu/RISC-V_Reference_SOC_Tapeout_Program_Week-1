# RISC-V Reference SOC Tapeout Program Week-1

This repository contains all my **Week 1 learnings, notes, and lab work** from the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**.  
The focus of Week 1 is on **RTL design, logic synthesis, timing libraries, and optimization techniques** using open-source tools like **iverilog, GTKWave, and Yosys** with the **Sky130 PDK**.
