---
Welcome to **Day 5 of Workshop!** üéâ

Today, we will focus on **optimization techniques in synthesis** and learn how different coding styles in Verilog impact **hardware generation** and **resource utilization**.  

We will also dive deep into:
- Understanding Optimization in Synthesis
- `if` and `case` constructs,
- Labs on **"Incomplete `if case`"**
- Labs on **"Incomplete overlapping Case"**
- for loop and for generate
- Labs on **"for loop"** and **"for generate"**

## **1. Optimization in Synthesis**

### **What is Synthesis Optimization?**
Synthesis optimization is the process where the synthesis tool improves RTL to generate **area-efficient**, **power-efficient**, and **performance-optimized** gate-level hardware.

---

### **Goals of Optimization**
| **Goal**        | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Area Optimization** | Reduce the number of logic gates and flip-flops. |
| **Speed Optimization** | Improve timing performance and reduce propagation delay. |
| **Power Optimization** | Reduce dynamic and static power consumption. |

---

### **Why Optimization Matters**
- Poor RTL coding leads to:
  - Unnecessary logic.
  - **Latch inference** (unintended memory elements).
  - Increased area and power.
- Optimized coding ensures:
  - Predictable hardware behavior.
  - Efficient designs for FPGAs and ASICs.

---

## **2. `if` and 'case' constructs in Verilog**

### **Understanding `if` Constructs**
- `if` statements are **priority-based**.
- In synthesis, they map to **priority encoders**.

**Example:**
```verilog
if (cond1)
    y = 2'b01;
else if (cond2)
    y = 2'b10;
else
    y = 2'b00;
```

**Common Issue: Incomplete `if`**
- Problem: If all possible conditions are not covered, the synthesis tool infers a latch to hold the previous value.
- Latches are undesirable in synchronous designs.

**Incorrect Code:**
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (enable)
        y = data;   // ‚ùå No else condition ‚Üí latch inferred
end
```

**Optimized Code:**
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (enable)
        y = data;
    else
        y = 0;      // ‚úÖ Fully specified
end
```
### **Understanding case Statements**
- `case` is used for multi-way selection.
- In synthesis, it maps to multiplexers.

**Example:**
```verilog
case (sel)
    2'b00: y = 0;
    2'b01: y = 1;
    2'b10: y = 2;
    2'b11: y = 3;
endcase
```
**Common Issue: Incomplete or Overlapping case**
- Incomplete case : Not all input possibilities are handled ‚Üí leads to latch inference.
- Overlapping case : Multiple case items match simultaneously ‚Üí leads to priority ambiguity.
- 

## **Lab-1 : Incomplete `if`**
Understand how an incomplete if statement can infer latches during synthesis and cause unwanted behavior in hardware.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [incomp_if.v](./verilog_files/incom_if.v)
```verilog
module incomp_if (
    input i0, 
    input i1, 
    input i2, 
    output reg y
);
always @(*) begin
    if (i0)
        y <= i1;    // ‚ùå No else statement ‚Üí latch inferred
end
endmodule
```
**Explanation:**
- The always @(*) block models combinational logic.
- When i0 = 1, the output y is assigned the value of i1.
-  **Problem:**
  - When i0 = 0, there is no assignment to y, so the synthesis tool infers memory (a latch) to hold the previous value of y.
  - This unintended latch can cause timing issues and unpredictable behavior in your circuit.

**Observations**
 - Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
   
   <img src = "./images/incomp_if_sim1.png">

  The RTL simulation behaves as if y simply holds its last value when i0 = 0.

- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/incomp_if_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):
  
   <img src = "./images/incomp_if_sim2.png">

    A latch is introduced, and the waveform now shows glitches or unexpected behavior.
  

## **Lab-2 : Incomplete if-else if**

Demonstrate how chained if-else if statements, when incomplete, lead to latch inference and create unintended memory in your design.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [incomp_if2.v](./verilog_files/incomp_if2.v)
```verilog
module incomp_if2 (
    input i0, 
    input i1, 
    input i2, 
    input i3, 
    output reg y
);
always @(*) begin
    if (i0)
        y <= i1;      // When i0 is 1 ‚Üí assign i1
    else if (i2)
        y <= i3;      // When i0 is 0 and i2 is 1 ‚Üí assign i3
    // ‚ùå Missing else statement ‚Üí latch inferred when both i0=0 and i2=0
end
endmodule
```
**Explanation:**
- When i0 = 1, y is assigned the value of i1.
- When i0 = 0 and i2 = 1, y is assigned the value of i3.
- Problem:
  - When i0 = 0 and i2 = 0, there is no assignment to y.
  - Synthesis tool infers a latch to store the previous value of y.

**Mismatch Between RTL and GLS:**
- RTL simulation appears correct, as the simulator simply keeps the previous value of y.
- Post-synthesis GLS shows glitches due to the actual physical latch being inferred.

**Observations**
- Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
  
  <img src = "./images/incomp_if2_sim1.png">

  The output y holds its previous value whenever i0=0 and i2=0.
  Looks fine, but misleading!

- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/incomp_if_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):
  
  <img src = "./images/incomp_if2_sim2.png">
  The latch causes glitches and timing hazards visible in GLS waveforms.


## **Lab-3 : Complete Case Statement**
 
Understanding how using a complete case statement ensures that no latches are inferred, leading to clean, predictable hardware.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [comp_case.v](./verilog_files/comp_case.v)

```verilog
module comp_case (
    input i0, 
    input i1, 
    input i2, 
    input [1:0] sel, 
    output reg y
);
always @(*) begin
    case (sel)
        2'b00 : y = i0;      // Select input i0
        2'b01 : y = i1;      // Select input i1
        default : y = i2;    // ‚úÖ Covers all other cases ‚Üí no latch inferred
    endcase
end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- sel is a 2-bit select line:
  - 00 ‚Üí y = i0
  - 01 ‚Üí y = i1
  - Other combinations (10 or 11) ‚Üí y = i2
- Default case ensures completeness:
  - Every possible value of sel has a defined output.
  - This prevents latch inference during synthesis.

**Observations**
- Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
  
  <img src = "./images/comp_case_sim1.png">

- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/comp_case_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):
  
  <img src = "./images/comp_case_sim2.png">

## **Lab-4 : Incomplete Overlapping Case with Wildcards**

Understand the risks of using wildcards (?) in case statements (casez or casex), and how incomplete or overlapping cases can lead to unpredictable synthesis behavior and simulation mismatches.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [bad_case.v](./verilog_files/bad_case.v)
```verilog
module bad_case (
    input i0, input i1, input i2, input i3,
    input [1:0] sel,
    output reg y
);
always @(*) begin
    case (sel)
        2'b00: y = i0;      // Select input i0
        2'b01: y = i1;      // Select input i1
        2'b10: y = i2;      // Select input i2
        2'b1?: y = i3;      // ‚ùå Wildcard matches 10 or 11 ‚Üí overlapping case
    endcase
end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- The select line sel is 2 bits wide (00, 01, 10, 11).
- The 2'b1? pattern uses ? as a wildcard, meaning:
  - 10 or 11 both match this condition.
- Problem: Overlap occurs because:
  - 2'b10 matches two lines:
    - Explicit case: 2'b10: y = i2;
    - Wildcard case: 2'b1?: y = i3;
  - This causes ambiguous behavior, as synthesis and simulation may prioritize differently.

**Why This is Dangerous:**

| Issue	 | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Overlapping cases |	Tools may resolve ambiguity differently ‚Üí simulation vs synthesis mismatch.|
| Missing default branch |	When sel = 11, behavior is completely dependent on synthesis tool interpretation.|
| Use of wildcards (?)	| Hides bugs during RTL simulation, leading to difficult-to-debug GLS issues.|

**Obseravtaions**

- Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
  - RTL will follow the first matching case, meaning:
    - For sel=10, y = i2.
    - For sel=11, y = i3.
      
  <img src = "./images/bad_case_sim1.png">

- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/bad_case_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):
  - Synthesis tools may optimize logic differently, possibly giving:
  - For sel=10, ambiguous output (depends on optimization rules).
    
  <img src = "./images/bad_case_sim2.png">
  
  - Mismatch between RTL and gate-level simulation.
 
## **Lab-5 : Partial Case Assignment**

Learn how partially assigning outputs in case statements can infer unintended latches, leading to incorrect synthesis results and mismatches between RTL and GLS.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [partial_case_assign.v](./verilog_files/partial_case_assign.v)

```verilog
module partial_case_assign (
    input i0, input i1, input i2,
    input [1:0] sel,
    output reg y, output reg x
);
always @(*) begin
    case (sel)
        2'b00: begin
            y = i0;     // ‚úÖ Both outputs are assigned
            x = i2;
        end
        2'b01: y = i1;  // ‚ùå Only 'y' is assigned ‚Üí 'x' holds previous value (latch inferred)
        default: begin
            x = i1;
            y = i2;
        end
    endcase
end
endmodule
```

**Problem Explanation:**
- Signal x is not assigned in the 2'b01 branch:
  - When sel = 01, x retains its previous value, causing the synthesis tool to infer a latch for x.
- Why it matters:
  - In combinational logic (always @(*)), every output must be fully assigned in every path to avoid memory elements.
  - If even one signal is left out in a branch, the synthesis tool assumes you intended to store its value.


**Observations**
- Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
  
  <img src = "./images/partial_case_assign_sim1.png">
  
  The output x appears stable, holding its last value when sel = 01.

- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/partial_case_assign_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):
  
  <img src = "./images/partial_case_assign_sim1.png">
  
  A latch is added for x, causing glitches or unexpected behavior in real hardware.

## `for` loops and `for generate` loops

### `for` Loops in Verilog
- Avoid repetitive code by looping over repetitive hardware structures.
- Synthesizable for loops are unrolled during synthesis.
- Used inside `always` block.
  
### `for generate` Loops in Verilog
- for generate is used when repeating hardware at compile time, not during runtime.
- Allows parametric hardware designs.
- Used outside `always` block

## **Lab-6 Using for Loop in RTL Design**

Understand how to use a for loop inside an always block to create iterative hardware structures, such as multiplexers, and how synthesis tools unroll these loops into combinational logic.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [mux_for.v](./verilog_files/mux_for.v)
```verilog
module mux_for (
    input i0, input i1, input i2, input i3,
    input [1:0] sel,
    output reg y
);
    // Combine inputs into a single bus for easy indexing
    wire [3:0] i_int;
    assign i_int = {i3, i2, i1, i0};

    integer k;  // Loop variable

    always @(*) begin
        for (k = 0; k < 4; k = k + 1) begin
            if (k == sel)
                y = i_int[k];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**

- Input Packing:
  - The four inputs i0, i1, i2, and i3 are combined into a 4-bit vector i_int for easier indexing: ```i_int = {i3, i2, i1, i0}```
  - Example: ```i3=1, i2=0, i1=1, i0=0 ‚Üí i_int = 4'b1010```
- For Loop Behavior:
  - The loop iterates from 0 to 3.
  - When the loop index k equals the sel value, the output y is assigned the corresponding bit from i_int.
- Example Operation:

  |sel	| y Output|
  |-----|---------|
  |2'b00|	i0|
  |2'b01	|i1|
  |2'b10	|i2|
  |2'b11	|i3|

**Obseravtions**
- Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
  
   <img src = "./images/mux_for_sim1.png">
   
    RTL behaves like a 4-to-1 multiplexer, selecting one of the inputs based on sel.


- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/mux_for_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):

  <img src = "./images/mux_for_sim2.png">
  
    The synthesis tool unrolls the loop, creating parallel logic equivalent to a normal case statement.
    The hardware is identical to a standard multiplexer.


## **Lab-7 : Demultiplexer using Case and For Loop**

Understand how to implement an 8-to-1 demultiplexer in Verilog using both a case statement and a for loop inside an always block, and observe how both approaches produce the same hardware behavior.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [demux_case.v](./verilog_files/demux_case.v)
```verilog
module demux_case (
    output o0, output o1, output o2, output o3,
    output o4, output o5, output o6, output o7,
    input [2:0] sel,
    input i
);
    reg [7:0] y_int;
    assign {o7, o6, o5, o4, o3, o2, o1, o0} = y_int;

    always @(*) begin
        y_int = 8'b0;
        case(sel)
            3'b000 : y_int[0] = i;
            3'b001 : y_int[1] = i;
            3'b010 : y_int[2] = i;
            3'b011 : y_int[3] = i;
            3'b100 : y_int[4] = i;
            3'b101 : y_int[5] = i;
            3'b110 : y_int[6] = i;
            3'b111 : y_int[7] = i;
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

Verilog Code ‚Äì [demux_for.v](./verilog_files/demux_for.v)
```verilog
module demux_for ( 
    output o0, output o1, output o2, output o3,
    output o4, output o5, output o6, output o7,
    input [2:0] sel,
    input i
);
    reg [7:0] y_int;
    assign {o7, o6, o5, o4, o3, o2, o1, o0} = y_int;
    integer k;

    always @(*) begin
        y_int = 8'b0;
        for (k = 0; k < 8; k = k + 1) begin
            if (k == sel)
                y_int[k] = i;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

**Explanation**
- Input and Output Mapping
- The demux takes a 3-bit select signal sel and a single input i.
- The output is 8 one-hot signals {o0, o1, ..., o7}.
- Internally, y_int stores the output bits and is assigned to outputs as:
    ```iverilog assign {o7, o6, o5, o4, o3, o2, o1, o0} = y_int;
    ```

**Case Statement Behavior**

- The case block explicitly maps each sel value to a corresponding output bit:
  - sel = 3'b000 ‚Üí o0 = i
  - sel = 3'b001 ‚Üí o1 = i
  - ...
  - sel = 3'b111 ‚Üí o7 = i
- Only the selected output is set to 1; others remain 0.

**For Loop Behavior**

- A for loop iterates through all output bits 0‚Äì7.
- When the loop index matches sel, the corresponding bit is set to i.
- Functionally equivalent to the case statement, but more scalable for larger demuxes.

**Example Operation**

  |sel	|Output (o7..o0)|
  |-----|---------------|
  |3'b000|	0000000i0|
  |3'b001	|000000i1|
  |3'b010	|00000i2|
  |3'b111	|i7|

- For i = 1 and sel = 3'b010, the output o2 = 1, all others = 0.
- Both case and for produce the same one-hot output.

**Observations:**
- Before Synthesis (RTL Simulation):
  
    <img src = "./images/demux_case_sim1.png">
    <img src = "./images/demux_for_sim1.png">
    
  - Both modules behave as an 8-to-1 demultiplexer, selecting one output based on sel.
 
- Gate level netlist:
  
  <img src ="./images/demux_case_netlist.png">
  
  <img src ="./images/demux_for_netlist.png">

- After Synthesis (GLS Simulation):
  
    <img src = "./images/demux_case_sim2.png">
    <img src = "./images/demux_for_sim2.png">
    
  - The for loop is unrolled by the synthesis tool into parallel logic.
  - The hardware is identical to the case statement implementation.
 
## **Lab-8 : Using Generate For Loop in RTL Design (RCA Example)**

Understand how to use a generate-for loop in Verilog to instantiate repetitive hardware modules (like full adders) efficiently and how synthesis tools handle these loops to create combinational logic structures.

Verilog Code ‚Äì [rca.v](./verilog_files/rca.v) , [fa.v](./verilog_files/fa.v)

**Explanation**
- **RCA Architecture**
  - The ripple-carry adder (RCA) adds two 8-bit numbers, producing a 9-bit sum.
  - Each full adder (FA) computes a single-bit sum and carry:
      ```bash
      sum[i] = num1[i] ‚äï num2[i] ‚äï carry_in[i]
      carry_out[i] = (num1[i] & num2[i]) | (carry_in[i] & (num1[i] ‚äï num2[i]))
      ```
**Generate For Loop Behavior**
- genvar i creates a loop variable for module instantiation.
- The loop instantiates full adders for bits 1 to 7.
- fa u_fa_1 instances are connected such that each FA uses the previous carry as input.
- Bit 0 FA is instantiated separately, with carry_in = 0.

**Advantages**
- Scalability: Easy to extend to N-bit adders by changing loop limits.
- Readability: Reduces repetitive code.
- Synthesis: The generate loop is unrolled by the synthesis tool into multiple full-adder instances.

**Operation Example**
  |num1|num2|sum|
  |----|----|---|
  |8'b00001101|8'b00000111|9'b00010100|
  
- Each bit is added with proper carry propagation.

- int_co stores internal carries, int_sum stores bitwise sums.

- sum[8] captures the final carry-out.

- This demonstrates how generate-for loops simplify iterative hardware instantiation in Verilog.
