# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

Welcome to Day 1 of the RTL Workshop!  
Today, you'll start building your digital design skills by writing Verilog code, simulating it with Icarus Verilog, and synthesizing designs using Yosys.  
This guide is hands-on, with clear steps and labs to help you get started.

# Understanding Simulator, Design, and Testbench in Verilog

Understanding the roles of **Simulator**, **Design**, and **Testbench** is essential for anyone working with **Verilog RTL design**.  
These three components form the backbone of **digital design verification** before moving to synthesis or actual chip fabrication. üöÄ

## üìå 1. Simulator
- A **simulator** is a tool that **mimics the behavior of your digital circuit** before it‚Äôs built in hardware.  
- It helps you verify whether your Verilog design works as expected and debug issues in a safe, virtual environment.
- **`iverilog`** is the open source simulator we are using in our workshop

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Design (DUT ‚Äì Design Under Test)
- The **Design**, also called the **UUT (Unit Under Test)** or **DUT (Design Under Test)**, represents the **actual hardware logic**.
- Actual **verilog** code which describes how data flows and how operations are performed at the **Register Transfer Level (RTL)**.

## üß™ 3. Testbench
- Testbench is an environmental setup to apply stimulus(test_vectors) to design and check functionality.
- It supplies **inputs (stimulus)** to the DUT and monitors the **outputs (responses)**.

## üîÑ 4. How simulator works
- Simulator looks for the changes on the input signals.
- If there is no change to the input ‚û°Ô∏è no change to the output.
- Generates **waveform files (`.vcd`)** to visualize signals in tools like **GTKWave**.



## Labs using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave

**Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** lets you compile and simulate Verilog designs.
